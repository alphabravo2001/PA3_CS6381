# Designing the logic is left as an exercise for the student. Please see the
# PublisherMW.py file as to how the middleware side of things are constructed
# and accordingly design things for the broker side of things.
#
# As mentioned earlier, a broker serves as a proxy and hence has both
# publisher and subscriber roles. So in addition to the REQ socket to talk to the
# Discovery service, it will have both PUB and SUB sockets as it must work on
# behalf of the real publishers and subscribers. So this will have the logic of
# both publisher and subscriber middleware.
